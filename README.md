# AICTE_OIBSIP_Task1
Calculator

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a simple calculator web application as part of the internship task for Oasis Infobyte. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with other functionalities like percentage calculation and clearing the input.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed using the calculator.
- **Percentage Calculation:** Users can calculate percentages using the "%" button.
- **Clear Input:** The "AC" button clears the input field, allowing users to start a new calculation.
- **Delete Functionality:** The "DEL" button deletes the last character entered in the input.
- **Plus/Minus Toggle:** The "&#xB1;" button toggles the sign of the input value between positive and negative.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Structured the calculator layout and interface.
- **CSS:** Styled the calculator for an intuitive and visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented functionality for arithmetic operations and user interactions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/nayanatara07/AICTE_OIBSIP_Task1.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the calculator.
3. Use the buttons to input numbers and perform arithmetic operations.
4. Press "=" to see the result of the calculation.
5. Use the other buttons for additional functionalities such as percentage calculation, clearing input, and toggling the sign.
